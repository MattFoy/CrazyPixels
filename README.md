# CrazyPixels
Cellular autotmata screensaver with a colourful rock-paper-scissors implementation.

To configure the way the cellular automata behave there is a Settings file that contain static variables that control many aspects of the calculations.
Additionally, the Settings file contains a number of preset combinations that yield interesting results.

# TODO:

Create and imbed demo videos.

Build into a .jar, wrap in a .exe, rename to .scr and it's a screensaver.
(Would be nice to account for /p /s /c command line args)

Create a setting to control the speed at which colour transitions take place.

Fix issue with screen resolution / multi monitor setups.
