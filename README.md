Cellular autotmata screensaver with a colourful rock-paper-scissors implementation.

To configure the way the cellular automata behave there is a Settings file that contain static variables that control many aspects of the calculations.
Additionally, the Settings file contains a number of preset combinations that yield interesting results.

This design was originally inspired by the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4cV0nCIZoc
But I found that if the settings were tweaked you could produce even more interesting results and patterns!

Each sample highlights a unique combination of settings to create a mesmerizing outcome. Enjoy!

## TODO:

1) Fix issue with screen resolution / multi monitor setups.

2) Build into a .jar, wrap in a .exe, rename to .scr and it's a screensaver.
(Would be nice to account for /p /s /c command line args)

3) Add the ability to click and drag to paint swathes of colours on the grid.
